# Device tree for Poco F5 Pro | Redmi K60

## Known issues
- Device Specific Issues:
- Fingerprint works on Goodix devices (most devices) and does not work on FPC devices.
- Q: How do you identify your fingerprint device? (Goodix or FPC)
- A: Install "Device Info HW" from GooglePlay to check it.

- PSï¼šI only have a K60 of Goodix device, so I'm temporarily unable to fix this issue.
